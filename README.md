# Python Practice
### This repository contains python questions from Hackerank to practice python programming, logic and reasoning abilities. 

All files are written in python.

#### 1. leap-year
An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.

In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:

The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years. Source

Task

Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.

Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguments to the is_leap function. It is only necessary to complete the is_leap function.

#### 2. triangle-quest

You are given a positive integer . Print a numerical triangle of height  like the one below:

1
22
333
4444
55555
......
Can you do it using only arithmetic operations, a single for loop and print statement?

Use no more than two lines. The first line (the for statement) is already written for you. You have to complete the print statement.

Note: DO not use anything related to strings.


#### 3. Printing first and last names

You are given the firstname and lastname of a person on two different lines. Your task is to read them and print the following:

Hello firstname lastname! You just delved into python.

Function Description

Complete the print_full_name function in the editor below.

print_full_name has the following parameters:

string first: the first name
string last: the last name
